[*]Explanation of the tool :

For the first option (Hash chacker), the user is asked to enter two hashes, and they are compared to see if they are the same hash or not.

[*] For the second option (Hash length), the user is asked to enter the hash and the "len" command is used to know the length of the hash.

[*] For the third option (Hash type), the user is asked to enter the hash and the hash length is compared to the standard length for each type of hash to know the hash type.

[*] For the fourth option (MD5 Encrypte), the user is asked to enter the text he wants to encrypt and "hashlib.md5" is used to encrypt the text.

[*] For the fifth option (MD5 Decrypte), the user is prompted to enter a hash and file name containing a list of possible words, each word in the file is checked and MD5-encrypted for comparison with the entered hash, and if it is found
